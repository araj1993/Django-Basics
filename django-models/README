# Models
 - Django models are the blue print of your database.
 - the models.py file is imported with ** from django.db import models **
 - each model in the models.py represent a table in DB and attribute are the columns.
 - django automatically create the ID ie, the PK.
 - model must be registered in the admin.py to view it from the django admin modal.

### Workflow of this Django project:

 - Created a new proect
   - django-admin startproject BookStore

 - Created an app called Books
   - python manage.py startapp Books

 - The floowing settings were done:
   - settings. py : added 'Books' to the installed app section, template dir path was updated.
   - urls.py was copied from BookStore to Books.
   - Created a template folder inside Books app

 - Created 2 models: 
   - Books : title, author, price
   - BooksTypes : books (FK), gener, language

 - Make and applied migration:
   - python manage.py makemigrations
   - python manage.py migrate

 - Created superuser
   - python manage.py createsuperuser (login for DB via built-in django admin)

 - Registered the models on admin.py to enable data management via built-in django admin
   - admin.site.resgister(Books)
   - admin.site.register(BookTypes)

 - Created template and updated the view.py, urls.py to access models via django.    

##### Notes
 - Can login to DB via django admin with the superuser and pwd created and add details to each table, which can then be seen on the db inside the project. 
 - Adding the migration files too for future reference.
