Workflow of the project:
1. Create a project for Library Management, with 2 apps:
  - Library_admin
  - Library_user

2. Basice setting of app registering on settings.py, copying urls.py to both app are done

3. Created a forms.py on admin add and added details of a form to collect data from user:
  - book name, author, published date and price

4. Created the view function for the form created; add_book_info()
  - since the form is a UI to collect data from user, the request method is POST
  - if method is POST then get cleaned data from user for title, author, dop and price.
  - request to render the html page with details, form is passed as context.

5. Created template to render add_book_info form; add_book_info.html
  - In the html page a <form> tage is created and inside that the {% csrf token %} is provided along with the format in which form is to be displayed : {{ form.as_p }}
  - Create a button to submit the data. The submitted data can be viewed in the terminal from where we ran the runserver command.

6. Added urls of created view function.


Note**
The created form submit data and it is not saved anywhere, instead we can display it in the terminal from where we run the runserver command.
To save these data we need to create a model for the add_book_info view function. (Models create tables on DB for each model class).


Convert normal forms to model forms: 
1. Create a model in the models.py file: AddBookInfo
2. Do makemigrations and migrate
3. Update the view function: instead of printing the values to terminal, now we save the values to the model created by:
   <model_name>.object.create(col1 = value, col2 = value, ...)
4. Run the server and enter values and click submit button: data will be saved to DB. 


To render the data saved in DB to UI(html page)
1. Create a fucntion under view.py to render the html page; create the html page under the templates/ folder
2. html page: loop over the book infor and print each info.
3. update the urls.py to display the newly created html page.
